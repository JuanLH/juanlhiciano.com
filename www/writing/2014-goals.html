<p>This year I am going to propose myself a list of goals that I want to or would like to have done by the end of year 2014 at lease.</p>

<p>This are the things I would want to do, but I probably won&#39;t</p>

<h2>Examples/Portfolio</h2>

<p>The thing I want the most is example of the things I&#39;ve done or I capable to do. I hate myself when someone ask me: &#39;Do you know X?&#39; and I say: &#39;yes, I do&#39;, and then they said: &#39;Ok, cool send me some examples of work you have done in X&#39;, I just draw a blank and start looking at old Hard Drives, Flash Memories, Old Mails, Dropbox, Google Drive and olds computer to find something and start to think: he/she won&#39;t believe me if I said I don&#39;t have anything to show, they will think I am lying. I don&#39;t blame them, I understand, I won&#39;t believe it either if someone tells me it knows something and doesn&#39;t have anything to prove that, for me it just BS. So, I&#39;m telling BS too.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why I&#39;m going to create a portfolio, a collection of examples to show my potencial and what I am capable of.</p>



<h2>Write more</h2>

<p>I like to write but I don&#39;t do it well, so I would like to write more in order to improve my writing skills (english and spanish by the way).</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to write more, about everything it won&#39;t matter what, sometimes I don&#39;t write something because it was already been wrote, or it&#39;s a simple thing that everyone (I believe) knows.</p>

<p>I would turn this blog into a possible log of thing I&#39;m working on or I&#39;ve worked on and share my experiences.</p>


<h2>Work on a Big Project</h2>

<p>One thing that I would like to do, it&#39;s been on a BIG project, where I am not the &quot;expert&quot; or &quot;the master of universe of that project&quot;, I just want to be part and learn from other leader and how to approach things, not the I want to be the one dude that doesn&#39;t contribute to anything just code, but learn how other people with more experiencies handle things on a big project.</p>

<p>By a big project I mean a project who involves Back-end, front-end, tons of users and/or page request, fully web-based app and everything is created In house.</p>


<h2>Take JavaScript to another level</h2>

<p>So this mean I want to use JavaScript more and not just query some element and changed its style, so this could change if I got a change to work on a Big Project.</p>


<h2>Stay up to day on Web</h2>

<p>I spent couple of months outside the &#39;Staying up to day&#39; World due to work that had me busy and I was way behind already, the web is growing fast and I need to keep me updated.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how am I going to mesure this, but anyways.</p>


<h2>Attend Conferences</h2>

<p>Yup, that. I want to attend to more conferences In order to learn and help me to stay up to day.</p>
<p>By the way I went to <a href="http://ultimatedeveloperevent.com/boston-2013/">The Ultimate Developer Event Boston 2013</a> it was an amazing Event, hope I can go next time.</p>


<h2>Make a game</h2>

<p>I am probably make the game Snake, but anyways I just want to do a complete game that can be play well, with menues and stuff.</p>


<h2>Contribute to Open Source Projects</h2>

<p>I would love to contribute or create open source projects.</p>


<h2>Use CodePen</h2>

<p>I&#39;ve been looking at demos there since I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s been a while, and there some amazing example there that will blow your mind, anyways, so I am going to use <a href="http://codepen.io" target="new">CodePen</a> to publish anything, whatever cross my mind, it&#39;s just to share some code and awesome example or weird stuff.</p>

<h2>Publish on GitHub</h2>

<p>When is something that is too big for CodePen or whatever, I will post it here, in GitHub</p>
<p>I would like to create some library or some code that would be useful for developer, so I hope I could write at least 2 cool new Repositories that would be helpful for many people.</p><div class="Article-signature">—<a href="http://twitter.com/WellingGuzman">@WellingGuzman</a></div></div><div class="Article-footer"></div></article></div></div><footer id="footer"><div class="Content-wrapper"><div class="Site-footer-links"><a href="/about">About</a>•<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/WellingGuzman">Twitter</a>•<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/WellingGuzman">GitHub</a></div><div class="copyright">Copyright &copy; 2013&nbsp;<a href="https://plus.google.com/109985810023249441310/posts" rel="publisher">Welling Guzman</a></div></div></footer><script>(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
