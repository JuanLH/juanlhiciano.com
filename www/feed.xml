How can be too long if we only change the charset? one may ask.
First these are the errors I&#39;m talking about:
#1071 - Specified key was too long; max key length is 767 bytes
#1071 - Specified key was too long; max key length is 1000 bytes
#1071 - Specified key was too long; max key length is 3072 bytes
It can be any of those errors depending on whether the table&#39;s storage engine is: MySIAM, InnoDb or InnoDb with innodb_large_prefix enabled.
TL;DRutf8 charset requires only 3 bytes per character, while utf8mb4 requires 4 bytes, which mean you have to use at most 191 characters in your string column
191 characters x 4 bytes = 764 bytes which is less than the maximum length of 767 bytes;

String storageString storage size vary depends on if the column is fixed-length or variable-length, it also depends on the charset it takes more bytes to storage a japanese character than an ASCII/Latin letter.
As an example CHAR is a fixed-length while VARCHAR and TEXT are variable-length.
All fixed-length data types uses all the bytes declared it with, for example CHAR(16), no matter what&#39;s inside, there are not truncated as VARCHAR will be, but right padded with spaces to the specific length.
In the other hand using VARCHAR(16) MySQL internally will remove all trailing spaces from any variable-length column data type.
VARCHAR requires a prefix value of 1 byte to store the length of the string if the size is less than 256, otherwise it will uses 2 bytes.
One tip is not to use CHAR if you are not going to use all the characters almost all the time, because the size can pile up with empty strings column.
Character SetThe UTF8 character set uses a maximum of 3 bytes per character and only contains Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) characters, which is the home of 65,536 characters (16 bits) from U+0000 to U+FFFF.
The UTF8mb4 character set uses a maximum of 4 bytes per character which include all of BMP characters and Supplementary Multilingual Plane (SMP) which include another possibility of 65,536 new characters from U+10000 to U+1FFFF.
Emojis (Unicode characters)UTF8 can support emoji, but not all of them, all the new emoji are part of the SMP, so in other to support both basic and supplementary we must use UTF8mb4.
The sparkle emoji (✨ U+2728) is between U+0000 and U+FFFF then it can be used on utf8 but the Woman Health Worker (👩 U+1F469) which is not between U+0000 and U+FFFF, must use the utf8mb4 charset.
Index lengthNow all the characters use 4 bytes instead of 3, so all columns that has more than 191 characters now uses more than 767 bytes, because 192 x 4 bytes is 768 bytes.
The options were removing the index, keep using utf8 or reduce the length. Removing the index wasn&#39;t an option neither keep using the utf8, but reducing the length was possible was the columns will probably never met the actual length which is 255 characters, reducing it to 191 was optimal and in no way will harm the system.
ConclusionChanging all string columns that length are greater than 191 characters to 191.
If changing the length is not a possible or desired option, changing the column index to only a chunk of x characters.

Then I notice it was all the custom post slug that matches the page slug.

The site had three custom post, Films, Stories, Galleries, also for each custom post there is a page with the same name and slug which had a custom template, but I enter to thesite.com/films, thesite.com/stories or thesite.com/galleries it did not serve the right template, so I change thesite.com/films to thesite.com/filmz and it did work and serve the right template.

By seeing this behavior it has to be the custom post and his rewrite fault, this is part of the custom post:

&lt;?php
&#39;public&#39; =&gt; true,
&#39;show_ui&#39; =&gt; true,
&#39;has_archive&#39; =&gt; true,
&#39;publicly_queryable&#39; =&gt; true,

&#39;show_in_nav_menus&#39; =&gt; true

There is three solution to this:

Solution #1
Change the slug, but this is a wrong solution if you already had theses indexed.

Solution #2
Change &#39;has_archive&#39;=&gt; true to false and the /films would be ignore by the custom post.

Solution #3
Do not use the custom page, and customize the archive-{$post_type}.php file and forget about the specific page for each one.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Changing permalink on WordPress it&#39;s never, well at least it never gave me any headache, but when I change <code>/blog/%postname%/</code> to just <code>/%postname%/</code> some pages fell apart, and I was blaming the <code>.htaccess</code>, deleting it, recreating, let WordPress rebuild it, did a <code>flush_rewrite_rules();</code> and nothing was fixed.

At first I blame the library, searching and searching and I didn&#39;t find any solution that leads me to fix error. Every time I tried a connection I always get the error : Error: connect ECONNREFUSED.



var mysql = require('mysql');

So I wrote and issue and it was not a library issue, it was MAMP&#39;s MySQL bad configuration. There is two thing that can resolve this problem:

Solution #1
On MAMP disable Allow local access only.

Solution #2
run mysql_config --socket in the terminal and use the output as socketPath value


$ mysql_config --socket
/tmp/mysql.sock



Probably when you run mysql_config it would says:
-bash: mysql_config: command not found

In MAMP is located in: /Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/mysql_config so it would be: 


$ /Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/mysql_config --socket
/tmp/mysql.sock



You can use alias or export to make this long path short.



var connection = mysql.createConnection({
  socketPath : '/tmp/mysql.sock',
  host     : 'localhost',
  user       : 'root',
  password   : '123'

What I want

Host a Nodejs application in subdomain (subdomain.wellingguzman.com) on a server that does not support nodejs.
Keep it like if it was hosted on the same server.



Solution


Go to your hosting provider, and look for DNS Zone, on hostgator is under domains tab.



Add a Record, put the Name of the host, or subdomain (subdomain.wellingguzman.com), there is possible two types you would need, type A or CNAME. If you want to point to an IP you need a type A, but if you want to point to a domain/subdomain you need CNAME.

On Address/CNAME put the server&#39;s IP or subdomain, in my case the app is hosted on OpenShift and the CNAME would be something like nodejs-welling.rhcloud.com. 

TTL is Time to Live, amount of seconds the record cache would last.






This would do the trick, and every time subdomain.wellingguzman.com is typed it would request nodejs-welling.rhcloud.com.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I want to develop my first Node.js applications and host it as subdomain, but this server (shared on hostgator) does not support Node.js applications, and for a second I thought if I need to change server only for this?.

If the user, let&#39;s say, go to http://mysite.com/someword on mysite, and if that is not a post/page it would probably display a 404 page, but I didn&#39;t want that behavior I wanted to search if someword is a category slug or a tag and display posts in that category or tag, otherwise would show the normal 404 page.

So, this is what I did, I added a action to template_redirect hook, that is executed before WordPress determine which page is going to be loaded.

&lt;?php
add_action(&#39;template_redirect&#39;, &#39;_custom_redirect&#39;);
function _custom_redirect()
{
  global $wp_query;

  if ( $wp_query-&gt;is_404() )
  {
    // Here I take over 404 page
  }
}

So now, I know when it&#39;s a 404 page, I need to get the string it was passed on the url, in this case someword, so I can check if the string match a category or a tag name with that name.

This string is stored in a array named query_vars with the key name. query_vars is a variable member of WP_Query which WordPress uses to execute the main query.

&lt;?php
add_action(&#39;template_redirect&#39;, &#39;_custom_redirect&#39;);
function _custom_redirect()
{
  global $wp_query;

  if ( $wp_query-&gt;is_404() )
  {
    $page_name = $wp_query-&gt;query_vars[&#39;name&#39;];

    if ( ! $page_name )
      return;

    if ( ($category =  get_category_by_slug( $page_name )) )
    {
      // Here it found a category
    }
    elseif ( ($tag = get_term_by(&#39;slug&#39;, $page_name, &#39;post_tag&#39;) ) )
    {
      // Here it found a tag
    }
    else
    {
      // Is not a category or a tag
      return;
    }
  }
}

After this code WordPress would still &quot;believe&quot; it&#39;s a 404 page, I needed to add some more lines to changed this.

&lt;?php
add_action(&#39;template_redirect&#39;, &#39;_custom_redirect&#39;);
function _custom_redirect()
{
  global $wp_query;

  if ( $wp_query-&gt;is_404() )
  {
    $page_name = $wp_query-&gt;query_vars[&#39;name&#39;];

    if ( ! $page_name )
      return;

    if ( ($category =  get_category_by_slug( $page_name )) )
    {
      // Here it found a category
      $wp_query-&gt;is_category = true;
    }
    elseif ( ($tag = get_term_by(&#39;slug&#39;, $page_name, &#39;post_tag&#39;) ) )
    {
      // Here it found a tag
      $wp_query-&gt;is_tag = true;
    }
    else
    {
      // Is not a category or a tag
      return;
    }

    $wp_query-&gt;is_404 = false;
    status_header( 200 );
  }
}

This is pretty much what I wanted to do, now I can get a tag or a category object if one exists, otherwise WordPress will keep its own process and will display its normal 404 page.

If I actually got a tag or category object, I need to query all posts under it.

&lt;?php
add_action(&#39;template_redirect&#39;, &#39;_custom_redirect&#39;);
function _custom_redirect()
{
  global $wp_query;

  if ( $wp_query-&gt;is_404() )
  {
    $page_name = $wp_query-&gt;query_vars[&#39;name&#39;];

    if ( ! $page_name )
      return;

    $query_args = &#39;&#39;;
    if ( ($category =  get_category_by_slug( $page_name )) )
    {
      // Here we found a category
      $wp_query-&gt;is_category = true;
      $query_args = &#39;category_name=&#39; . $category-&gt;slug;
    }
    elseif ( ($tag = get_term_by(&#39;slug&#39;, $page_name, &#39;post_tag&#39;) ) )
    {
      // Here we found a tag
      $wp_query-&gt;is_tag = true;
      $query_args = &#39;tag=&#39; . $tag-&gt;slug;
    }
    else
    {
      // Is not a category or a tag
      return;
    }

    $wp_query-&gt;is_404 = false;
    $wp_query-&gt;is_archive = true;
    status_header( 200 );

    query_posts( $query_args );
  }
}

If status_header( 200 ); isn&#39;t added the HTTP status will always be a 404, so this line change the status code from 404 to 200.

This is about it, but I want a little bit more, I want if is_category(); or is_tag(); functions are used, it has to return true. In order to make this to happen I needed to set a couple of variables more.

&lt;?php
$wp_query-&gt;set(&#39;category_name&#39;, $category-&gt;slug);
$wp_query-&gt;set(&#39;cat&#39;, $category-&gt;term_id);

$wp_query-&gt;set(&#39;tag&#39;, $tag-&gt;slug);
$wp_query-&gt;set(&#39;tag_id&#39;, $tag-&gt;term_id);

$wp_query-&gt;set() will set a variable to query_vars array, which as I mentioned before is used by WordPress main query. With this variables set, when WordPress executes is_category(); or is_tag(); would have category or tag specific variable values to check if is a category/tag or not. 

Final code

&lt;?php
add_action(&#39;template_redirect&#39;, &#39;_custom_redirect&#39;);
function _custom_redirect()
{
  global $wp_query;

  if ( $wp_query-&gt;is_404() )
  {
    $page_name = $wp_query-&gt;query_vars[&#39;name&#39;];

    if ( ! $page_name )
      return;

    $query_args = &#39;&#39;;
    if ( ($category =  get_category_by_slug( $page_name )) )
    {
      // Here we found a category
      $wp_query-&gt;is_category = true;
      $wp_query-&gt;set(&#39;category_name&#39;, $category-&gt;slug);
      $wp_query-&gt;set(&#39;cat&#39;, $category-&gt;term_id);

      $query_args = &#39;category_name=&#39; . $category-&gt;slug;
    }
    elseif ( ($tag = get_term_by(&#39;slug&#39;, $page_name, &#39;post_tag&#39;) ) )
    {
      // Here we found a tag
      $wp_query-&gt;is_tag = true;
      $wp_query-&gt;set(&#39;tag&#39;, $tag-&gt;slug);
      $wp_query-&gt;set(&#39;tag_id&#39;, $tag-&gt;term_id);

      $query_args = &#39;tag=&#39; . $tag-&gt;slug;
    }
    else
    {
      // Is not a category or a tag
      return;
    }

    $wp_query-&gt;is_404 = false;
    $wp_query-&gt;is_archive = true;
    status_header( 200 );

    query_posts( $query_args );
  }
}

This would be helpful too if you want to log/register/email requested pages that ends up being a 404 page.

NOTE: if you don&#39;t have any category or tag template page will returns a 404 page template, just take that in mind.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have site built with Wordpress and I wanted to catch all 404 page that Wordpress try to display and make my own custom 404 page depending on the requested page, or in fact I just wanted to whether or not show a 404 page.</p>

<!-- more -->
<p>If the user, let&#39;s say, go to <code><a href="http://mysite.com/someword">http://mysite.com/someword</a></code> on mysite, and if that is not a post/page it would probably display a 404 page, but I didn&#39;t want that behavior I wanted to search if <code>someword</code> is a category slug or a tag and display posts in that category or tag, otherwise would show the normal 404 page.</p>

<p>So, this is what I did, I added a action to <code>template_redirect</code> hook, that is executed before WordPress determine which page is going to be loaded.</p>

<pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php
add_action(&#39;template_redirect&#39;, &#39;_custom_redirect&#39;);
function _custom_redirect()
{
  global $wp_query;

  if ( $wp_query-&gt;is_404() )
  {
    // Here I take over 404 page
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>So now, I know when it&#39;s a 404 page, I need to get the string it was passed on the url, in this case <code>someword</code>, so I can check if the string match a category or a tag name with that name.</p>

<p>This string is stored in a array named <code>query_vars</code> with the key <code>name</code>. <code>query_vars</code> is a variable member of <code>WP_Query</code> which WordPress uses to execute the main query.</p>

<pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php
add_action(&#39;template_redirect&#39;, &#39;_custom_redirect&#39;);
function _custom_redirect()
{
  global $wp_query;

  if ( $wp_query-&gt;is_404() )
  {
    $page_name = $wp_query-&gt;query_vars[&#39;name&#39;];

    if ( ! $page_name )
      return;

    if ( ($category =  get_category_by_slug( $page_name )) )
    {
      // Here it found a category
    }
    elseif ( ($tag = get_term_by(&#39;slug&#39;, $page_name, &#39;post_tag&#39;) ) )
    {
      // Here it found a tag
    }
    else
    {
      // Is not a category or a tag
      return;
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>After this code WordPress would still &quot;believe&quot; it&#39;s a 404 page, I needed to add some more lines to changed this.</p>

<pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php
add_action(&#39;template_redirect&#39;, &#39;_custom_redirect&#39;);
function _custom_redirect()
{
  global $wp_query;

  if ( $wp_query-&gt;is_404() )
  {
    $page_name = $wp_query-&gt;query_vars[&#39;name&#39;];

    if ( ! $page_name )
      return;

    if ( ($category =  get_category_by_slug( $page_name )) )
    {
      // Here it found a category
      $wp_query-&gt;is_category = true;
    }
    elseif ( ($tag = get_term_by(&#39;slug&#39;, $page_name, &#39;post_tag&#39;) ) )
    {
      // Here it found a tag
      $wp_query-&gt;is_tag = true;
    }
    else
    {
      // Is not a category or a tag
      return;
    }

    $wp_query-&gt;is_404 = false;
    status_header( 200 );
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is pretty much what I wanted to do, now I can get a <em>tag</em> or a <em>category</em> object if one exists, otherwise WordPress will keep its own process and will display its normal 404 page.</p>

<p>If I actually got a tag or category object, I need to query all posts under it.</p>

<pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php
add_action(&#39;template_redirect&#39;, &#39;_custom_redirect&#39;);

This year I am going to propose myself a list of goals that I want to or would like to have done by the end of year 2014 at lease.

This are the things I would want to do, but I probably won&#39;t


Examples/Portfolio

The thing I want the most is example of the things I&#39;ve done or I capable to do. I hate myself when someone ask me: &#39;Do you know X?&#39; and I say: &#39;yes, I do&#39;, and then they said: &#39;Ok, cool send me some examples of work you have done in X&#39;, I just draw a blank and start looking at old Hard Drives, Flash Memories, Old Mails, Dropbox, Google Drive and olds computer to find something and start to think: he/she won&#39;t believe me if I said I don&#39;t have anything to show, they will think I am lying. I don&#39;t blame them, I understand, I won&#39;t believe it either if someone tells me it knows something and doesn&#39;t have anything to prove that, for me it just BS. So, I&#39;m telling BS too.

That&#39;s why I&#39;m going to create a portfolio, a collection of examples to show my potencial and what I am capable of.



Write more

I like to write but I don&#39;t do it well, so I would like to write more in order to improve my writing skills (english and spanish by the way).

I&#39;m going to write more, about everything it won&#39;t matter what, sometimes I don&#39;t write something because it was already been wrote, or it&#39;s a simple thing that everyone (I believe) knows.

I would turn this blog into a possible log of thing I&#39;m working on or I&#39;ve worked on and share my experiences.


Work on a Big Project

One thing that I would like to do, it&#39;s been on a BIG project, where I am not the &quot;expert&quot; or &quot;the master of universe of that project&quot;, I just want to be part and learn from other leader and how to approach things, not the I want to be the one dude that doesn&#39;t contribute to anything just code, but learn how other people with more experiencies handle things on a big project.

By a big project I mean a project who involves Back-end, front-end, tons of users and/or page request, fully web-based app and everything is created In house.


Take JavaScript to another level

So this mean I want to use JavaScript more and not just query some element and changed its style, so this could change if I got a change to work on a Big Project.


Stay up to day on Web

I spent couple of months outside the &#39;Staying up to day&#39; World due to work that had me busy and I was way behind already, the web is growing fast and I need to keep me updated.

I don&#39;t know how am I going to mesure this, but anyways.


Attend Conferences

Yup, that. I want to attend to more conferences In order to learn and help me to stay up to day.
By the way I went to The Ultimate Developer Event Boston 2013 it was an amazing Event, hope I can go next time.


Make a game

I am probably make the game Snake, but anyways I just want to do a complete game that can be play well, with menues and stuff.


Contribute to Open Source Projects

I would love to contribute or create open source projects.


Use CodePen

I&#39;ve been looking at demos there since I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s been a while, and there some amazing example there that will blow your mind, anyways, so I am going to use CodePen to publish anything, whatever cross my mind, it&#39;s just to share some code and awesome example or weird stuff.

Publish on GitHub

When is something that is too big for CodePen or whatever, I will post it here, in GitHub
I would like to create some library or some code that would be useful for developer, so I hope I could write at least 2 cool new Repositories that would be helpful for many people.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Late Happy New year to everybody who is not reading this and won&#39;t be reading this until whoever knows how they get in here.</p>

This post will also make me keep track of all I need/use.


Browsers

I always download all my browsers first.

Safari

Safari comes by default on Mac OS X.

Google Chrome

This is (by now) my favorite/default browser, is the first thing I downloaded on every new or new install machine, in other words if there not chrome installed, I install it right away. Go and download Google Chrome, just give it a try. If you are under linux you might want to check Chromium

So as a Web Developer I mostly use Chrome because of its DevTools. Chrome DevTools is an amazing tool for debugging web applications. Give Chrome Dev Tools a try.

Google Chrome Canary

Is Google Chrome but from the future.

As a Web Developer this is a good thing because you can test new features before it came to the official Chrome Release (Stable), sometimes this features come on Chrome stable version as experimental but some are not.

Firefox

The next browser is Firefox and as a Web Developer I use Firefox to check if the web app works on it, and playing around with 3D View.

Opera

I open up opera only for testing, so that as a Web Developer I use opera. Download Opera you need it if you are going to bet for the web.

Internet Explorer

Wut?

Text Editors/IDE

Well we need something to edit all our source code files, I use the following:

Sublime Text
Sublime Text, is a multiplatform text editor and can be customizable, has a lot of plugins, themes and color schema and support a lot of programming languages.

Coda
Coda, is a great IDE with a lot of built-in features including Full File Browser (FTP, SFTP, WebDAV, and S3) and MySQL Editor.

I used to Install TextWrangler, but sublime text fits all my needs.


Tools

iTerm2

iTerm is an alternative to Terminal, it supports split view that why love it the most.

Git

I use Git to control and manage all my source code. Read more and download Git, also check GitHub.

NodeJS

I do not really use NodeJS, but I need to install NodeJS in order to install some awesome tools like grunt.

GruntJS

Grunt is a javascript task runner that helps us to automate task, like copying files, concatenating files, adding css prefixes, compiling sass and much much more.

Bower

Bower is a frontend package manager, as its name stated, manage all our frontend packages, one command and Bower will install all dependecies for us automatically.

Yeoman

I&#39;ve just used Yeoman couple of times, but this is a great tool/workflow that help us out creating new application boilerplates, Yeoman uses Grunt and Bower.

CodeKit

CodeKit is an amazing tool for Mac OS X that make Web Developer lives a lot easier, it compiles everything sass, less, halm, stylus, coffeescript, compass and more, combine and minify files, optimizes images, live page reloads and much much more.

Local Environment

MAMP PRO

This is a quick and easy way (click-next install) to set up on a Mac, Apache, MySQL and PHP. I need this to use/create/test PHP/MySQL locally on my machine.

phpMyAdmin

Yup, this is the tool I used for MySQL Database Management. It&#39;s written in PHP and comes with MAMP PRO.

Collaboration/Comunication

Skype
Skype, if you work with remote clients/team-mate, you need something to talk to them, Google Hangout is an option.

Wunderlist
Wunderlist, here is where I keep all my todo task, even outside Developing, like run out of Dr. Pepper. It also syncs in all my devices.

<p>I open up opera only for testing, so that as a Web Developer I use opera. <a href="http://www.opera.com/" target="new">Download Opera</a> you need it if you are going to bet for the web.</p>

<h3>Internet Explorer</h3>

<p>Wut?<br><img src="http://wellingguzman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/JackSparrowConfused.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="155"></p>

<h2>Text Editors/IDE</h2>

<p>Well we need something to edit all our source code files, I use the following:</p>

<h3>Sublime Text</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/" target="new">Sublime Text</a>, is a multiplatform text editor and can be customizable, has a lot of plugins, themes and color schema and support a lot of programming languages.</p>

<h3>Coda</h3>
<p><a href="http://panic.com/coda/" target="new">Coda</a>, is a great IDE with a lot of built-in features including Full File Browser (FTP, SFTP, WebDAV, and S3) and MySQL Editor.</p>

<p>I used to Install <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/" target="new">TextWrangler</a>, but sublime text fits all my needs.</p>


<h2>Tools</h2>

<h3>iTerm2</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.iterm2.com/" target="new">iTerm</a> is an alternative to Terminal, it supports split view that why love it the most.</p>

<h3>Git</h3>

<p>I use Git to control and manage all my source code. <a href="http://git-scm.com/" target="new">Read more and download Git</a>, also check <a href="http://github.com/" target="new">GitHub</a>.</p>

<h3>NodeJS</h3>

<p>I do not really use <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="new">NodeJS</a>, but I need to install NodeJS in order to install some awesome tools like grunt.</p>

<h3>GruntJS</h3>

<p><a href="http://gruntjs.com/" target="new">Grunt</a> is a javascript task runner that helps us to automate task, like copying files, concatenating files, adding css prefixes, compiling sass and much much more.</p>

<h3>Bower</h3>

<p><a href="http://bower.io/" target="new">Bower</a> is a frontend package manager, as its name stated, manage all our frontend packages, one command and Bower will install all dependecies for us automatically.</p>

<h3>Yeoman</h3>

<p>I&#39;ve just used <a href="http://yeoman.io/" target="new">Yeoman</a> couple of times, but this is a great tool/workflow that help us out creating new application boilerplates, Yeoman uses Grunt and Bower.</p>

<h3>CodeKit</h3>

<p><a href="http://incident57.com/codekit/" target="new">CodeKit</a> is an amazing tool for Mac OS X that make Web Developer lives a lot easier, it compiles everything sass, less, halm, stylus, coffeescript, compass and more, combine and minify files, optimizes images, live page reloads and much much more.

<h2>Local Environment</h2>

<h3>MAMP PRO</h3>

<p>This is a quick and easy way (click-next install) to set up on a <strong>M</strong>ac, <strong>A</strong>pache, <strong>M</strong>ySQL and <strong>P</strong>HP. I need this to use/create/test PHP/MySQL locally on my machine.</p>

Chrome Canary is updated almost everyday, it&#39;s mean would be fresh builds. It can run side by side with Google Chrome stable version, so you don&#39;t have to choose one of the two, one thing to know is that you can&#39;t use Canary as your default browser.

Although this is designed for Developers and early adopters, you should be aware this could crash sometimes even has more chances to if you are using experimental features.


This is a quick view of canary I did in a couple of hours to get my hands dirty, if you want to be ahead and test features that would be available later on Google Chrome check this out.

I have been seeing this Chrome gold icon for a while, wondering what it is, I just thought it was just kind a cool icon for Chrome and nothing else, but HEY! it&#39;s not, is your Google Chrome Browser from the FUTURE!, so now let&#39;s see what bring us.

First of all this is Version 31.0.1632.0 canary.

Visually Stuff

Now the first we notice when we open up Developer Tools is that now it organizes by tabs rather than grouped list-item, I do like this new way to handle this section now, you don&#39;t have to scroll all the way down looking for an specific section, it&#39;s worst when you have thousands of CSS declarations. Also metrics section was merged with styles section. We can see its difference in the image below.





In sources panel the paused exceptions buttons was moved from bottom bar to sidebar as you can see in the next image.





They removed Collect CSS Selector Profile from Profile panel.





DevTools Settings are now neat, it has smaller font size and more organized than before.






Features

Enough of visually things, now let&#39;s see what features I found:

Inspect DOM Element
The first thing I check was the popup menu from DOM Inspector.






Inspect DOM Element is a new option that come in handy when you want a quick access to a DOM element properties, this save us time because we don&#39;t need to go to console and query that element using jQuery or querySelector or any of those anymore, now it&#39;s just a click ahead.

EventTarget
In the properties tab of DOM inspector now included EventTarget which can tell us if the element can receive DOM events, even though the most common events targets are window, Element, and document which are the ones we commonly use.





Working with CSS Preprocessor
Now in canary we have CSS and Javascript source maps enabled by default, we don&#39;t need to enable Enable Developer Tools experiments to enabled this on the experiments tab.





This all I got, most of the features I was testing I later notice that it was already available to the current Google Chrome stable version, so all the new stuff on Canary or already available (on stable) I&#39;m going to keep posting here.

Go and Download it here, it&#39;s only available for Mac and Windows, but if you are on linux you can check Chromium Dev Channel and have weekly updates.

Si este es el caso este problema puede ser un dolor de cabeza, por lo cual para esto tenemos dos forma como resolver.

Metodo 1
Si tienes acceso al archivo php.ini en tu servidor este metodo es el indicado, de lo contrario debes utilizar el Metodo 2. para esto debemos localizar el archivo php.ini para una rapida consulta, en un archivo php ejecutamos el metodo phpinfo(); y nos mostrara una serie pero las que nos interesa son dos en particular: Configuration File (php.ini) Path y Loaded Configuration File la cual nos indica donde esta el archivo php.ini.

Si los valores de Configuration File (php.ini) Path y Loaded Configuration File son diferentes deben utilizar Loaded Configuration File. ya que es el archivo que esta cargado actualmente.

La diferencia que hay entre Configuration File (php.ini) Path y Loaded Configuration File es que el archivo php.ini por defecto es Configuration File (php.ini) Path y Loaded Configuration File el que se esta utilizando actualmente, ya que php permite al usuario crear su propio php.ini, o si utilizas XAMPP, WAMP, MAMP o algo parecido para crear tu servidor es muy probable que ellos tengan su propio php.ini.

Ya que sabes cual archivo modificar, lo abres y edita con tu editor de texto favorito y buscar error_reporting y verificar que el valor sea error_reporting = E_ALL luego unas lineas mas abajo deberá aparecer display_errors verifica que tenga display_errors = On

Solo tendras que reiniciar el servidor y los errores volverán aparecer.

NOTA: Si lo errores siguen sin aparecer, y sigue mostrando 500 Internal Service Error en vez de un error de PHP debes verificar que el Software que uses para manejar el servidor ya sea XAMPP, WAMP, MAMP, etc. no manejen ellos mismo el php.ini, ya que estos mismo por mas que modifiques el php.ini lo modificaran ya que estos valores lo cambiarias por el cliente mismo en la Sección de PHP Manejo de Errores.

Metodo 2

El metodo 2 lo utilizas si no tienes acceso al php.ini o no quieres modificarlos de todo caso este metodo para hacer que reaparezcan esos errores al inicio del archivo php deberás agregar estas linea, que vendría siendo lo mismo que modificaríamos en php.ini.

&lt;?php
error_reporting(E_ALL);
ini_set(&#39;display_errors&#39;, &#39;On&#39;);

Y Con esto tenemos los errores de PHP devuelta en nuestro servidor.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Este error lo puede causar diferentes acciones, pero en este caso me refiero que apache en vez de presentar un error de php, como la variable no existe, el archivo no existe o cualquier otro tipo de error, muestra <strong>Apache 500 Internal Server Error</strong>.</p>

En CodeIgniter 2.1.3 es la version que utilizo actualmente tiene por defecto estas configuraciones de sesión.

Sesiones CodeIgniter

&lt;?php
$config[&#39;sess_cookie_name&#39;]     = &#39;ci_session&#39;;
$config[&#39;sess_expiration&#39;]      = 7200;
$config[&#39;sess_expire_on_close&#39;] = FALSE;
$config[&#39;sess_encrypt_cookie&#39;]  = FALSE;
$config[&#39;sess_use_database&#39;]    = FALSE;
$config[&#39;sess_table_name&#39;]      = &#39;ci_sessions&#39;;
$config[&#39;sess_match_ip&#39;]        = FALSE;
$config[&#39;sess_match_useragent&#39;] = TRUE;
$config[&#39;sess_time_to_update&#39;]  = 300;

Como podrán notar en $config[&#39;sess_expiration&#39;]    = 7200; nos indica que la session expirara después de 7200 segundos de ser creada, que resulta ser 2 horas, la cual se ira actualizando en cada ejecución y en fin el caso seria que si dura 2 horas (7200 segundos) inactiva expirara.

Esto me estaba funcionando perfectamente en mi servidor local hasta que trate de subirlo a un servidor remoto en la cual no encontraba cual seria el problema que no podia iniciar sesión, pense que el servidor no me estaba guardando o trabajando las sesiones pero si las almacenabas.

Investigando encontre el problema y la solución.

Problema
El problema estaba en que el servidor remoto estaba en un pais con diferencia de horario mayor a 2 horas a mi pais de residencia, la cual el problema funcionaba de esta manera:

Iniciaba Sesión en la web a las 08:00am.
El servidor creaba las sesiones y le indicaba al navegador local que esta sesión expiran en 2 horas de su hora local que es 01:00am, la cual nos indica que la sesión habra terminado a las 03:00am si no la consultan antes de esta hora.
Cuando inmediatamente volvia a preguntar por la sesión que acaba de crear... ¡BANG! no funciona porque ya expiro a las 03:00am hace 5 horas según el servidor, según mi navegador (cliente local) no es nada cierto.

Solución

Pues la solución es bastante simple, Incrementar el tiempo de expiración de la sesión, la cual seria 1 dia, así no encontraríamos ningún problema con el servidor y el cliente. Hay ciertos países que tienen casi 1 dia de diferencia así que pueden variar o elegir el valor que prefieran.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>He estado utilizando <strong>Codeigniter</strong> por mucho tiempo localmente y remotamente pero nunca me habia pasado algo como esto, tratando de utilizar las sesiones localmente funcionaban sin ningún problema, pero al utilizarlo en un servidor, las sesiones no querían funcionar, no querían almacenarse ni mantenerse su tiempo indicado en la configuración de CodeIgniter.</p>
