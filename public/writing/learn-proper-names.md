<p>Someone asked me if I knew what Lambdas was, and quickly I answered: “I’ve heard that word before, but really don’t know what it is”.</p>

<p>It turned out that I do knew what it was, just didn’t know it was called Lambdas, for me Lambdas was a shiny Ruby only feature or something. But Lambdas are Anonymous functions, I use it everyday without knowing it was also called Lambdas.</p>
