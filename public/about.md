I am a software engineer focusing on web technologies and web-related solutions. I am passionate about the web, system design, open source, computers, mentoring, teaching and _reinventing the wheel_*. I can summarize it into solving technical problems.

I enjoy designing and building APIs, writing documentation, Software as a Service (SaaS), serverless, and building infrastructure. I also enjoy accessibility, game development, Mac, and iOS development but I have close to zero experience.

_*I am passionate about how things works and were made. I love recreating things for the sake of learning. We could learn why something was created and what problem it solved._
