My name is Welling Guzm√°n, I have a degree in Computer Engineering, passionate about the web, building software, performance, open source software and _reinventing the wheel_*.

Currently I have been helping build [Directus](https://getdirectus.com), a open-source headless CMS & API for managing databases content.

_* I am passionate about how things works and were made. I love recreating things for the sake of learning. We can learn why something was created and what problem was solved._
