My name is Welling Guzm√°n, I have a degree in Computer Engineer, passionate about the web, building software, performance, open source software and _reinventing the wheel_.

Currently I'm helping build [Directus](https://getdirectus.com), a open-source headless CMS & API for managing databases content.
