I am a software engineer focusing on web technologies and web-related solutions. I am passionate about the web, system design, open source, computers, mentoring, teaching and _reinventing the wheel_*.

APIs, infrastructure, accessibility, game development, MacOS, and iOS development are some of the stuff I enjoy working with.
