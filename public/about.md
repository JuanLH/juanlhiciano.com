My name is Welling Guzm√°n, I have a degree in Computer Engineering, passionate about the web, building software, performance, open source software and _reinventing the wheel_.

Currently I have been helping build [Directus](https://getdirectus.com), a open-source headless CMS & API for managing databases content.
