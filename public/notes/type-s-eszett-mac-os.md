<p>How to type this ß (Eszett) or weird-looking "B" as I knew it before in Mac and iPhone.</p>

<span id="more-428"></span>

<h2>Mac OS</h2>
<p>The "s" needs to be lowercase</p>
<pre class="text"><code>alt/option/⌥ + s</code></pre>

<h2>iOS</h2>
<p>Using the German Keyboard: <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4509" target="_blank">here is how to add new keyboards</a></p>
<pre class="text"><code>hold down "s" and choose it from the list</code></pre>

<p>This is how it's going to look if you hold down the key on a uppercase "S"</p>

<p>Here is if you hold down lowercase "s"</p>

<p>Why is this weird-looking "B" under "s" instead of "B", well in fact it is because is an actual "long s" sound, also called sharp s.</p>


<h2>What am I doing with this?</h2>
<p>I started to seriously learn German, well, using Duolingo, Duolingo-serious, and while I have been using the app it never gave me a wrong answer using "u" instead of "ü" or "b/B" instead of "ß", but it started to giving me this as a wrong answer.</p>
