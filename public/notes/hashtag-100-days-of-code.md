I found old codes I wrote more than a decade ago and realized how much I have learned so far, still there is a lot more to learn.

I feel bad when I have to search for a simple task, such as, how substring minus start position works? I have used it a lot of times and still forget how it works.

I used to create a lot of things, even useless app because I like to make things. Lately it has been different as I was believing I should act more "Pro" and just build things that matter and useful to at least a group of people.

I realized I should go back to my roots and create things just for fun. I don't have to worry about whether or not is perfect or useful just make things works and learn something new.

I have been thinking on challenging myself on coding a project each week or code something everyday for a n period of time, but I did not find any strong motivation until today.

Today I came across a [tweet](https://twitter.com/wilto/status/994216304503590912) and a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0bsKc4tiuY) that looked like it was directly written to me, these put the cherry on top and I decided to make the **#100DaysOfCode** challenge.

The rules are basically:
- Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.
- Publish your progress

The goals will be create around 20 mini projects in the next 100 days.
