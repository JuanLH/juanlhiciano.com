This is probably has been said a lot out there, but I wanted to tell you this again, if you like to express an idea, a experience or simply want to share your thoughts, write it down while you got the momentum going.

If you love something and want to say how much you love it, say it while you love it, and when you stop loving it, you can share it again and compare saying why you stop loving it.
