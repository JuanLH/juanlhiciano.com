This is probably has been said a lot out there, but I wanted to tell you this again, if you like to express an idea, a experience or simply want to share your thoughts, write it down while you got the momentum going.

If you love something and want to say how much you love it, say it while you love it, and when you stop loving it, you can share it again and compare saying why you stop loving it.

If you want to share something today, and you are like me, there's a high chance that tomorrow you won't feel that spark that make you feel that you need it to share something.

I want to share so much, but then I end up thinking, who wants to read this anyway, who will find this anyway.

Don't be me and share your thoughts, it doesn't matter that you think it's worthless, someone will find it worth it.

I say this not because I do it, but because I've been on the other side as a reader, reading comments about how they hate the post AND the author of it, while I'm sitting here thinking why do they hate them, they are awesome and this content is great.

Please, share your thoughts, I'll take my own advice and do the same.
