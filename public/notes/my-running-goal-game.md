The other day I was watching Modern Family, and Phil was running on a elliptical machine, and he promise his wife is will run the distance from his house to Canada.

I decided to take this goal and next year I'll be running from somewhere to somewhere else, I don't know it yet, but the idea will be fun, and it will keep me going and motivate me to run.
