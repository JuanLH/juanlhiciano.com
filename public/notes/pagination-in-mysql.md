Having a large dataset and you only need to fetch a specific number of rows, you can use the `LIMIT` clasue in the query to limit the rows in the result.

Pagination refers to process of dividing a dataset into smaller parts.

The benefits of pagination are:

- Faster way to fetch data from a big dataset rather than fetching the whole dataset.
- A cleaner way to visualize the data.
