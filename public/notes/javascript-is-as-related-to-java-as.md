Some people mix *JavaScript* with *Java*, thinking they are the same thing or one are based on the other.

There is a comparison that start with "Javascript is related to java as _something_ is to _some_" is a clever and funny comparison to me.

So this would be a list of this comparison phrases:

- JavaScript is related to Java as Hamburger is to Ham.
- JavaScript is related to Java as Hamster is to Ham.
- JavaScript is related to Java as Rocket is to Rock.
- JavaScript is related to Java as Carnival is to Car. _From YDKJS Books_
- More to come...
