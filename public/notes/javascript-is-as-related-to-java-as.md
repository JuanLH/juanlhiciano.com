Some people mix *JavaScript* with *Java*, thinking they are the same thing or one are based on the other.

There is a comparison that start with "Javascript is related to java as _something_ is to _some_" is a clever and funny comparison to me.

So this would be a list of this comparison phrases:

- Java is related to JavaScript as Ham is to Hamburger.
- Java is related to JavaScript as Ham is to Hamster.
- Java is related to JavaScript as Rock is to Rocket.
- JavaScript is related to Java as Carnival is to Car. _From YDKJS Books_
- More to come...
