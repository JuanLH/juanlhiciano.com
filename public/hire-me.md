# Hi, I am Welling Guzman.

I am a Software Engineer and I am looking for a new opportunity to help you with your projects. Remote opportunities preferably.

I have a degree in Computer Engineering. I have worked with Development Agencies and  startups to materialize their ideas into projects, reviewed their codebase and provided professional advise based on their goals, built minimum viable product (MVP), helped their team to solve or advised them about possible solutions to technical problems and be available for any questions they may have.

## Area of expertise & skills:

- API Design, Integration and Development
- Web Applications
- Desktop Applications
- Software and Database architecture
- Responsive Web Design
- Comfortable working with Linux/Unix servers
- Apache and NGINX.
- PHP, JavaScript, HTML5/XHTML, CSS3/Sass/Less
- jQuery, Backbone.js
- Zend DB, Slim Framework
- SQL, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server
- WordPress
- Gulp/Grunt
- Photoshop
- Mentoring

While these have been the languages, tools and area of my expertise I am consider myself a quick-learner which had led me into working with new projects with new tools and languages that I haven't used before.

Solving technical problem do not need to be attached to a set of tools or languages.

I may be helpful in some area that I have worked on the past. I have had the opportunity to work with NodeJS, Docker, Java, Consuming APIs with Android or iOS/Cocoa Framework (Objective-C), C/C++, Postgres, MongoDB, Redis, Visual FoxPro and Microsoft Windows.
